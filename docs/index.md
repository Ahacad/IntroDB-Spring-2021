## Homeworks

There will be roughly weekly homework. These will generally consist of a number of written problems. *Since there are also laboratory classes, theres homework will not involve any programming.*



!!! important
    **You are welcome to discuss these problems with other students, but this should be limited to discussions of high-level strategies and concepts. The actual write-up of the solutions must be your own.**

Homeworks needs to be submitted in class **<mark><u>Every Tuesday</u></mark>**. They can either be handwritten or  typed (LATEX is recommended) and print. However, your work must be clear and legible to receive credit.

Written solutions will not be posted, but the homework problems may be reviewed in **Q&A recitations**.

## Assignments

In the first few weeks, there are several simple assignments to help students understand the practicalities of database operation.

* [Assignment-1](Assignment/assignment1.md)

We will post each assignment here in **<u>Friday's class</u>**, and students are required to complete the work and have it checked by TAs in class.

## Projects

In this course, students will be required to complete **two course projects**.

`Project-1` will be posted after the completion of the first few weeks of assignments and `project-2` will be assigned after `project-1`. Students will have plenty of time to complete both projects, which will not be too difficult and will focus more on the understanding and application of databases.

* [Project-2](Project/project-2.md)
